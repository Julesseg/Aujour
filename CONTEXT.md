# Aujour — Ubiquitous Language

Aujour is a journaling app built on plain markdown files: one file per day,
living in a user-visible folder that can coexist with an Obsidian vault.

## Glossary

### Journal
The user's entire body of journaling: the tree of Entries under the Journal
Root. There is exactly one Journal per app installation. The Journal is fully
defined by the files on disk — Aujour holds no journal content of its own.

### Journal Root
The folder the Journal lives under. Defaults to a folder Aujour owns (visible
in the Files app); the user may instead point it anywhere they can pick in the
Files app — typically inside an Obsidian vault.

### Entry
One markdown file representing one Journal Day. At most one Entry exists per
Journal Day. An Entry's identity is its date, not its filename — the filename
and location are derived from the date via the Path Template.

### Journal Day
The date an Entry belongs to. Usually the calendar date, but the current
Journal Day does not advance until the Rollover Hour: with a 4 AM rollover,
1 AM on March 2nd still belongs to Journal Day March 1st. "Today's Entry"
means the Entry for the current Journal Day.

### Rollover Hour
A setting: the time of day at which the current Journal Day advances.
Defaults to midnight, which matches Obsidian's daily-notes behavior exactly.

### Path Template
A Moment-format string, relative to the Journal Root, that maps a date to an
Entry's file path — e.g. `YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD` (the default). Slashes create
subfolders, literal text goes in `[brackets]`, and `.md` is appended
automatically. A file is an Entry exactly when its path matches the current
Path Template for some date (see ADR 0002 for what happens on change).

The supported tokens are `YYYY`, `MM` and `DD` — the zero-padded numeric ones,
which have fixed widths and so read back unambiguously. Anything else (`MMMM`,
`ddd`, `D`, `YY`, …) is rejected, and an Entry template must name all three so
that every path identifies exactly one day.

### Content Template
The markdown skeleton a new Entry starts from. Placeholders use Obsidian's
`{{name}}` / `{{name:FORMAT}}` syntax; the Obsidian core set ({{date}},
{{time}}, {{title}}) is supported verbatim so an Obsidian daily-note template
pastes over unchanged, and Aujour-specific placeholders (e.g. {{photos}},
{{events}}) extend the same syntax.

### Placeholder
A `{{name}}` token in the Content Template (or typed directly into an Entry).
Three kinds:
- **Core placeholders** ({{date}}, {{time}}, {{title}}) — static text resolved
  when the Entry is spawned; identical to Obsidian's daily-notes set.
- **Data placeholders** ({{events}}, {{reminders}}, {{workout}}, …) — resolved
  at spawn from on-device data, formatted per user settings.
- **Interactive placeholders** ({{mood}}, {{location}}, …) — remain literal
  `{{name}}` text in the file until answered; Aujour renders them as inline
  widgets in the editor, and answering one replaces it with plain markdown
  text. Unanswered ones are harmless literal text in Obsidian.

Photos are deliberately *not* a placeholder: that day's photos are offered by
a suggestion panel and inserted as Attachments where the user chooses.

### Parked File
A file set aside as `{filename}_1.md` beside an Entry when two files claim
the same day — a template-migration collision, or sync divergence where the
older version loses the Entry path. Parked Files are never Entries; they hold
content awaiting a manual merge, and sit adjacent to the Entry precisely so
the user notices them in Obsidian or Files.

### Attachment
A non-markdown file (typically a photo) referenced by an Entry. Attachments
live under the Attachment Path Template — the same Moment format restricted to
folders (no `.md`, and it need not name a day), relative to the Journal Root,
default `[attachments]/YYYY/MM` — and are referenced
relatively from Entries. Embeds are written in standard markdown syntax by
default (Obsidian wiki-style available as a setting); Aujour renders both.
